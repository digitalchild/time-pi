## TimePi - The Raspberry Pi TimeLapse Project 

This is yet another time lapse project for the Raspberry Pi which aims to create a long term time lapse camera based on the Raspberry Pi and the Camera Module. 

The aims of this project is to create a device that can take time lapses of an entire day from battery power. These images will be archived locally and then synced to a network server at the end of the time. The ultimate aim is to have the device self powered using possibly solar power and wind power as a backup. The physical size of the device aims to be no bigger than a CCTV camera from the late 80's.
